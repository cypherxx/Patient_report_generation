      <strong>Information - fund of general knowledge; long-term memory; recall</strong>
      The Information subtest reflects two factors in the child's development of language and knowledge: 1) The richness
      of the child's verbal environment during His development is reflected in the fund of knowledge. 2) The ability to
      store that knowledge in long-term memory, recall it, and verbally express it is an individual ability that is
      measured by the Information subtest. On this subtest <span class="input__name">...</span> has scored at <span
        class="input__verbal_tests_0">...</span> level.
    </section>
    <section>
      <strong>Comprehension - Understanding social rules and ethics; common sense and judgment</strong>
      The Comprehension subtest is based on social comprehension, a skill that is deficient in many LD and ADHD
      children. The social understanding that underlies the Comprehension subtest is greatly influenced by environment.
      Ethical judgment may be lacking for a variety of reasons - intellectual, environmental, and emotional. For
      children with significantly
      weak comprehension subtest scores, direct instruction in social skills may be required. He has scored at <span
        class="input__verbal_tests_1">...</span> level.

      <strong>Arithmetic - Numerical reasoning; attention and concentration</strong>
      The numerical tasks of the Arithmetic subtest are worked out "in the child's head". He must have the ability to
      attend to the verbally presented problem and concentrate on working out the answer in His short-term memory.
      Performance on Arithmetic also requires a mastery of the mathematical operations required by each item, and
      therefore reveals information on the child's achievement in arithmetic learning. On this subtest, his score is at
      <span class="input__verbal_tests_2">...</span> level.

      <strong>Similarities - Verbal categories and concepts; abstract verbal reasoning</strong>
      In order to store language and information in long-term memory, humans use a process of categorization and
      conceptualization that develops from the concrete to the abstract. The Similarities subtest captures the child's
      ability to mentally process verbal information, categorizing and conceptualizing information in the long-term
      memory store. Over the course of the child's development, their conceptual skills progress from concrete to
      abstract reasoning, a process that is reflected in the Similarities subtest. <span class="input__name">...</span>
      has scored <span class="input__verbal_tests_3">...</span> level on this subtest.

      <strong>Digit Span - Short-term auditory memory; concentration and attention</strong>
      It is included in an assessment of the factor known as Freedom from Distractibility. High Digit Span scores
      suggest a superior ability to concentrate and memorize orally presented information. Here he has scored at <span
        class="input__verbal_tests_4">...</span> level.

      <strong>Picture Completion - Visual discrimination; attention to visual detail</strong>
      The skill reflected by the Picture Completion subtest is not visual acuity; it is visual discrimination. The child
      must look at the visual whole presented and analyze its parts to identify what is missing. A relatively simple
      task, poor performance in a child with Learning Difficulty/Disability may be related to visual-perceptual
      difficulties or environmental awareness. Here <span class="input__name">...</span> has <span
        class="input__performance_tests_0">...</span> score.
    </section>
    <section>
      <strong>Block Design - Abstract visual-perceptual ability; spatial and nonverbal problem-solving</strong>
      A pure test of perceptual intelligence, Block Design is the only perceptual subtest that factors heavily with
      overall intelligence. Block Design will give you a good clue to innate intellectual potential. However, Block
      Design is a visual-motor task and poor performance may be developmental or related to a motor deficiency. Here
      <span class="input__name">...</span> scored <span class="input__performance_tests_1">...</span> score.

      <strong>Object Assembly - Visual analysis and construction of a whole from its parts</strong>
      The Object Assembly subtest score reflects the visual-motor skills of puzzle construction. The child must analyze
      the object and construct the whole visual object from its parts within time constraints. His score on this subtest
      is at <span class="input__performance_tests_2">...</span> level.

      <strong>Coding - Visual motor coordination; speed; concentration</strong>
      An interesting performance subtests that measures visual motor skill. Coding gives clues to basic deficiencies in
      visual motor performance needed for writing. Good short-term memory improves performance on coding. It also
      factors with freedom from distractibility and the ability to concentrate to accomplish a visual motor task within
      time constraints. On this subtest, his score is at <span class="input__performance_tests_3"></span> range.

    <section>
      <strong>Mazes- Mental Planning Skills</strong>
      Mazes show the ability of mental planning, insight and attention to instructions of the child. It is a good
      measure of visuo-motor coordination with accuracy and speed. Here also he has scored at borderline level.

      Overall,<span class="input__name">...</span>’s Full-Scale Intelligence Quotient is <span contenteditable
        data-name="full_score">85</span> which indicate low average intellectual functioning. His
      verbal scale scores are better than his performance scale scores. <span contenteditable
        data-name="final_review">There is a discrepancy of above 24 points
        between the two scale scores, suggestive of presence of learning difficulty. He might exhibit difficulties in
        the
        areas of, visual discrimination, attention to visual detail, abstract visual-perceptual ability, spatial and
        nonverbal problem-solving, visual analysis and construction of a whole from its parts and mental planning
        skills</span>;
      which could influence his academic and day today functioning.
