        <p><b>Information - fund of general knowledge; long-term memory; recall</b></p>
        <p>The Information subtest reflects two factors in the child's development of language and knowledge: 1) The
            richness of the child's verbal
            environment during His development is reflected in the fund of knowledge. 2) The ability to store that
            knowledge in long -term memory, recall it, and
            verbally express it is an individual ability that is measured by the
            Information subtest.<u>On this subtest {{name}} has scored at
                {{verbal_tests.0 | Convert}} level.</u>
        </p>
        <p><b>Comprehension - Understanding social rules and ethics; common sense and judgment</b></p>
        <p>The Comprehension subtest is based on social comprehension, a skill that is deficient in many LD and ADHD
            children. The social understanding that underlies the Comprehension subtest is greatly influenced by
            environment. Ethical judgment may be lacking for a variety of reasons -
            intellectual, environmental, and emotional. For children with significantly
            weak comprehension subtest scores, direct instruction in social skills may be required.<u>He has scored at
                {{verbal_tests.1 | Convert}} level .</u>
        </p>
        <p><b>Arithmetic - Numerical reasoning; attention and concentration</b></p>
        <p>The numerical tasks of the Arithmetic subtest are worked out "in the
            child's head". He must have the ability to attend to the verbally presented problem and concentrate on
            working out the answer in His short-term
            memory. Performance on Arithmetic also requires a mastery of the
            mathematical operations required by each item, and therefore rev eals information on the child's achievement
            in arithmetic learning.
            <u>On this subtest, his score is at {{verbal_tests.2 | Convert}}
                level.</u>
        </p>
        <p><b>Similarities - Verbal categories and concepts; abstract verbal reasoning</b></p>
        <p>In order to store language and information in long -term memory, humans use a process of categorization and
            conceptualization that develops from the concrete to the abstract. The Similarities subtest captures the
            child's ability to mentally process verbal information, categorizing and
            conceptualizing information in the long-term memory store. Over the
            course of the child' s development, their conceptual skills progress from concrete to abstract reasoning, a
            process that is reflected in the
            Similarities subtest.

            suggest a superior ability to

        <p>The skill reflected by the Picture Completion subtest is not visual acuity; it is visual discrimination. The

            give you a good clue to innate intellectual potential. However, Block Design is a visual- motor task and

            puzzle construction. The child must analyze the object and construct the
            whole visual object from its parts within time constraints. <u>His score on this subtest is at below

        <p><b>Coding - Visual motor coordination; speed; concentration</b></p>
        <p>An interesting performance subtests that measures visual motor skill.
            Coding gives clues to basic deficiencies in visual motor performance
            needed for writing. Good short-term memory improves performance on coding. It also factors with freedom from
            distractibility and the ability to
            concentrate to accomplish a visual motor task within time constraints. <u>On this subtest, his score is at
                {{performance_tests.3 | Convert}} range.</u>
